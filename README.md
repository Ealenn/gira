Gira is a powerful command-line tool that bridges your Git workflow with both **Jira** and **GitHub Issues**. It helps you automate tasks like creating branches from issues, viewing issue details, and keeping issue tracking in sync with Git ‚Äî all from your terminal.

Use Gira to speed up development workflows, reduce context switching, and streamline project tracking ‚Äî whether you're using Jira, GitHub Issues, or both.

## üì¶ Installation

You can use Gira either as a native binary or through Docker. Choose what fits your environment best.

### üîß Automatic

Automated install/update, don't forget to always verify what you're piping into bash.

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ealenn/gira/master/install_unix.sh | bash
```

#### ü™ü Windows

```sh
Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ealenn/gira/master/install_windows.ps1 | Invoke-Expression

You can download the latest release directly from GitHub:

```sh
curl -sSL https://github.com/Ealenn/gira/releases/latest/download/gira-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/gira 
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gira
```

> This will place the gira binary in your system path for global use.

### üê≥ From Docker (No Install Required) 

If you prefer using Docker, you can run Gira directly without installing it:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ealen/gira
```

To make it easier to use Gira like a native CLI, add this alias to your shell config:

```sh
# In your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias gira='docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ealen/gira'
```

After reloading your shell, you'll be able to run gira from anywhere.

> üí° **Note**: The Gira Docker image is also available on GitHub Container Registry.
> 
> If your company restricts access to docker.io, you can use the GitHub-hosted image instead by replacing `ealen/gira` with `ghcr.io/ealenn/gira` in the above commands:
> ```sh
> alias gira='docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ghcr.io/ealenn/gira'
> ```

## ‚ú® Shell Autocompletion

Gira supports autocompletion for major shells like Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.

Generate the completion script with:

```sh
$ gira completion [shell]
```

Supported shells: `bash` ‚Äì `zsh` ‚Äì `fish` ‚Äì `powershell`

Example with ZSH :

```sh
# in your ~/.zshrc
eval "$(gira completion zsh)"
```

> This enables tab completion for Gira commands and flags in your shell.

## üöÄ Usage

```
Usage:
  gira [command]

Available Commands:
  branch      Create a new Git branch using issue
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  config      Configure Gira with accounts and tokens
  help        Help about any command
  issue       Show details of an issue (from current branch or specified issue ID)
  version     Display the current Gira version and check for available updates

Flags:
  -h, --help             help for gira
      --profile string   Configuration profile to use (default "default")
      --verbose          Print detailed operation logs and debug information
  -v, --version          version for gira

Use "gira [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

üêû Use the `--verbose` flag to display detailed exception or stack traces, which can help you better understand what went wrong.

This information is especially useful before creating a bug issue, as it provides more context for troubleshooting and reporting problems.

Example : 
```sh
‚ùØ gira branch TEST-123 --verbose
[DEBUG] Issue TEST-123 response status 404 
[FATAL] Unable to find issue TEST-123
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è `config`: Configure Gira profile with accounts and tokens

The `gira config` command sets up the Gira CLI by allowing you to configure one or more accounts, each with its own credentials. You can create multiple profiles to connect to different sources, making it easy to switch between environments or accounts.

For each profile, you'll provide the Jira host URL and API token. This information is stored in your configuration file and enables Gira to communicate with the specified Jira instance when running commands like `branch` or `issue`.

#### Default Profile

Running `gira config` with no additional arguments will set up or update your default profile:

```
‚ùØ gira config
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ‚Üì ‚Üë ‚Üí ‚Üê 
? Type: 
  ‚ñ∏ JIRA
    GITHUB

Enter the Jira API URL : https://jira.mycompany.com
Enter the Jira Token : **********
‚úÖ Done!
```

#### Custom Profiles

You can also configure custom profiles and use them in any Gira command by specifying the `--profile` option.

This is useful if you need to work with multiple Jira instances or accounts.

```
‚ùØ gira config --profile perso
Enter the Jira API URL : https://jira.personal.com
Enter the Jira Token : **********
‚úÖ Done!
```

Once configured, you can specify the profile in other commands:

```
‚ùØ gira branch --profile perso
```

This flexibility allows you to easily manage and switch between multiple Jira or Github accounts or environments as needed.

### üå± `branch`: Create a new Git branch using issue ID (Jira or GitHub)

Creates a new Git branch based on issue.

The branch name is generated by combining the issue ID with a slugified version of the issue summary (e.g., "feature/ABC-123/fix-login-bug"). 

This helps enforce consistent naming conventions and improve traceability between code and issues.

#### Usage 
```
Usage:
  gira branch [issue] [flags]

Aliases:
  branch, checkout

Examples:
  gira branch ISSUE-123
  gira branch -a ISSUE-123

Flags:
  -a, --assign   assign the issue to the currently logged-in user after creating the Git branch
  -f, --force    disable interactive prompts and force branch creation even if checks would normally prevent it
  -h, --help     help for branch
```

#### Example
```
‚ùØ gira branch ISSUE-123
Branch feature/ISSUE-123/update-app-dependencies-to-the-latest-version will be generated
Press ENTER to continue, CTRL+C to cancel
```

### üïµÔ∏è `issue`: Show details of issue (from current branch or specified issue ID)

Displays detailed information about an issue.

- If no issue ID is provided, the issue associated with the current Git branch is used.
- If an issue ID is specified, the command will display information for that issue.

This includes the issue key, summary, description, status, priority, assignee, and other relevant metadata.

Useful for quickly reviewing the context of your work without leaving the terminal.

#### Usage
```
Usage:
  gira issue [issueId] [flags]

Examples:
  gira issue
  gira issue ABC-123

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for issue
```

#### Example
```
‚ùØ gira issue

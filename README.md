Gira is a powerful command-line tool that bridges your Git workflow with both **Jira** and **GitHub** issues. 
It helps you automate tasks like creating branches from issue, viewing issue details, and keeping issue tracking in sync with Git — all from your terminal.

Use Gira to speed up development workflows, reduce context switching, and streamline project tracking whether you're using Jira, GitHub, or both.

You can download the latest release directly from GitHub:

```sh
curl -sSL https://github.com/Ealenn/gira/releases/latest/download/gira-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/gira 
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gira
```

> This will place the gira binary in your system path for global use.

### 🐳 Docker

If you prefer using Docker, you can run Gira directly without installing it:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ealen/gira
```

To make it easier to use Gira like a native CLI, add this alias to your shell config:

```sh
# In your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias gira='docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ealen/gira'
```

After reloading your shell, you'll be able to run gira from anywhere.

> 💡 **Note**: The Gira Docker image is also available on GitHub Container Registry.
> 
> If your company restricts access to docker.io, you can use the GitHub-hosted image instead by replacing `ealen/gira` with `ghcr.io/ealenn/gira` in the above commands:
> ```sh
> alias gira='docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ghcr.io/ealenn/gira'
> ```

## ✨ Shell Autocompletion

Gira supports autocompletion for major shells like Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.

Generate the completion script with:

```sh
$ gira completion [shell]
```

Supported shells: `bash` – `zsh` – `fish` – `powershell`

Example with ZSH :

```sh
# in your ~/.zshrc
eval "$(gira completion zsh)"
```

> This enables tab completion for Gira commands and flags in your shell.

## 🚀 Usage

```
Usage:
  gira [command]

Available Commands:
  branch      Create a new Git branch using issue
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  config      Configure Gira with accounts and tokens
  help        Help about any command
  issue       Show details of an issue (from current branch or specified issue ID)
  ninja       Create a new issue and associated branch in one command
  open        Open issue in web browser (from current branch or specified issue ID)
  version     Display the current Gira version and check for available updates

Flags:
      --ai               enable AI-powered features, such as branch name suggestions and other smart assistance
  -h, --help             help for gira
  -p  --profile string   configuration profile to use (default "default")
      --verbose          print detailed operation logs and debug information
  -v, --version          version for gira

Use "gira [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

🐞 Use the `--verbose` flag to display detailed exception or stack traces, which can help you better understand what went wrong.

This information is especially useful before creating a bug issue, as it provides more context for troubleshooting and reporting problems.

Example : 
```sh
❯ gira branch TEST-123 --verbose
[DEBUG] Issue TEST-123 response status 404 
[FATAL] Unable to find issue TEST-123
```

### ⚙️ `config`: Configure Gira profile with accounts and tokens

The `gira config` command sets up the Gira CLI by allowing you to configure one or more accounts, each with its own credentials. 

You can create multiple profiles to connect to different sources, such as `Jira` or `GitHub` issues, making it easy to switch between environments or accounts.

For each profile, you'll specify the source type along with the necessary credentials:

- For Jira: Provide the Jira host URL and API token.
- For GitHub: Provide optional GitHub personal access token.

This configuration is stored in your local Gira config file and enables the CLI to communicate with the appropriate service when running commands like `branch` or `issue`.

#### Default Profile

Running `gira config` with no additional arguments will set up or update your **default** profile:

```
❯ gira config
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ← 
? Type: 
  ▸ JIRA
    GITHUB

Enter the Jira API URL : https://jira.mycompany.com
Enter the Jira Token : **********
✅ Done!
```

#### Custom Profiles

You can also configure custom profiles and use them in any Gira command by specifying the `--profile` option.

This is useful if you need to work with multiple instances or accounts.

```
❯ gira config --profile perso
Enter the Jira API URL : https://jira.personal.com
Enter the Jira Token : **********
✅ Done!
```

Once configured, you can specify the profile in other commands:

```
❯ gira branch --profile perso
```

or 

```
❯ gira branch -p perso
```

This flexibility allows you to easily manage and switch between multiple Jira or Github accounts or environments as needed.

#### AI-powered features


Gira can enhance your workflow with **AI assistance**, helping you generate smarter branch names, commit messages and summaries, all without leaving your terminal.  

When enabled via the `--ai` flag, AI features work alongside your Git, Jira, and GitHub integrations:  

**Available AI-powered capabilities:**
- 🪄 **Branch name suggestions**: Automatically generate consistent and descriptive branch names from issue titles and descriptions.
- ✍️ **Commit message drafts**: Get AI-generated commit messages based on changes and issue context (you can still edit before committing).
- 📑 **Smart issue summaries**: Summarize long Jira or GitHub issue descriptions into concise overviews.

AI integration is optional and controlled through **environment variables**. 

| Environment Variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `GIRA_AI_ENDPOINT`   | Base URL of the AI endpoint. **Required** |
| `GIRA_AI_MODEL`      | Model name to use (depends on provider). **Required** |
| `GIRA_AI_APIKEY`     | API key for authentication (if required by provider). |

##### Usage <!-- omit in toc -->

Add the environment variables to your shell config (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.)

Then reload your shell and use `Gira` with the `--ai` flag !

> 💡 Tip: For maximum privacy, lower latency, and zero API costs, try [LocalAI](https://localai.io) or [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
> You can run models entirely on your machine, making Gira’s AI features work offline and securely.

### 🌱 `branch`: Create a new Git branch using issue ID (Jira or GitHub)

Creates a new Git branch based on issue.

The branch name is generated by combining the issue ID with a slugified version of the issue summary (e.g., "feature/ABC-123/fix-login-bug"). 

This helps enforce consistent naming conventions and improve traceability between code and issues.

#### Usage <!-- omit in toc -->
```
Usage:
  gira branch [issue] [flags]

Aliases:
  branch, checkout

Examples:
  gira branch ISSUE-123
  gira branch -a ISSUE-123

Flags:
  -a, --assign   assign the issue to the currently logged-in user after creating the Git branch
  -f, --force    disable interactive prompts and force branch creation even if checks would normally prevent it
  -h, --help     help for branch
```

#### Example <!-- omit in toc -->
```
❯ gira branch ISSUE-123
Branch feature/ISSUE-123/update-app-dependencies-to-the-latest-version will be generated
Press ENTER to continue, CTRL+C to cancel
```

### 🕵️ `issue`: Show details of issue (from current branch or specified issue ID)

Displays detailed information about an issue.

- If no issue ID is provided, the issue associated with the current Git branch is used.
- If an issue ID is specified, the command will display information for that issue.

This includes the issue key, summary, description, status, priority, assignee, and other relevant metadata.

Useful for quickly reviewing the context of your work without leaving the terminal.

#### Usage <!-- omit in toc -->
```
Usage:
  gira issue [issueId] [flags]

Examples:
  gira issue
  gira issue ABC-123

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for issue
```

#### Example <!-- omit in toc -->
```
❯ gira issue

### 🌐 `open`: Open the issue in your browser

The `gira open` command quickly opens the web page for the current issue (or a specified one) in your default browser.

It works with both Jira and GitHub Issues, making it easy to jump from the terminal directly to the issue tracker for viewing, editing, or commenting.

- If no issue ID is provided, open uses the issue associated with the current Git branch.
- If an issue ID is specified, it will open that issue directly.

### 🥷 `ninja`: Create a new issue and branch in one go

The `gira ninja` command speeds up your workflow by creating a new issue (in Jira or GitHub) and immediately generating a Git branch for it, all in a single step.

This is especially useful when starting work on a brand-new task and wanting to dive straight into coding.

#### Usage <!-- omit in toc -->
```
Usage:
  gira ninja [flags]

Flags:
  -f, --force   disable interactive prompts and force branch creation even if checks would normally prevent it

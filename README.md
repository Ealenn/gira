```

You can download the latest release directly from GitHub:

```sh
curl -sSL https://github.com/Ealenn/gira/releases/latest/download/gira-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/gira 
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gira
```

> This will place the gira binary in your system path for global use.

### üê≥ From Docker (No Install Required) 

If you prefer using Docker, you can run Gira directly without installing it:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ealen/gira
```

To make it easier to use Gira like a native CLI, add this alias to your shell config:

```sh
# In your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias gira='docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ealen/gira'
```

After reloading your shell, you'll be able to run gira from anywhere.

> üí° **Note**: The Gira Docker image is also available on GitHub Container Registry.
> 
> If your company restricts access to docker.io, you can use the GitHub-hosted image instead by replacing `ealen/gira` with `ghcr.io/ealenn/gira` in the above commands:
> ```sh
> alias gira='docker run -it --rm -v "$HOME:/root" -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app ghcr.io/ealenn/gira'
> ```

## ‚ú® Shell Autocompletion

Gira supports autocompletion for major shells like Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.

Generate the completion script with:

```sh
$ gira completion [shell]
```

Supported shells: `bash` ‚Äì `zsh` ‚Äì `fish` ‚Äì `powershell`

Example with ZSH :

```sh
# in your ~/.zshrc
eval "$(gira completion zsh)"
```

> This enables tab completion for Gira commands and flags in your shell.

## üöÄ Usage

```
Usage:
  gira [command]

Available Commands:
  branch      Create a new Git branch using Jira issue ID.
  config      Configure Gira with Jira account and API token
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command

```sh
‚ùØ DEBUG=1 gira branch TEST-123
[DEBUG] Issue TEST-123 response status 404 
[FATAL] Unable to find Jira TEST-123
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è `config`: Configure Gira with Jira account and API token

Configures the Gira CLI by setting up the Jira account credentials, including the Jira host URL, email, and API token.
This command updates the configuration file to enable communication with the Jira instance for subsequent commands like 'branch'.
Ensure you have a valid Jira API token from your Atlassian account before running this command.

```
‚ùØ gira config
Enter the Jira API URL (Example https://jira.mycompagny.com): https://jira.mycompagny.com
Enter the Jira Token (See /manage-profile/security/api-tokens): **********
‚úÖ Done!
```

### üå± `branch`: Create a new Git branch using Jira issue ID

Creates a new Git branch based on Jira issue.

The branch name is generated by combining the Jira issue ID with a slugified version of the issue summary (e.g., "feature/ABC-123/fix-login-bug"). 

This helps enforce consistent naming conventions and improve traceability between code and Jira issues.

#### Usage 
```
Usage:
  gira branch [Jira Issue ID] [flags]

Examples:
gira branch ISSUE-123
gira branch -a ISSUE-123

Aliases:
  branch, checkout

Flags:
  -a, --assign   assign the issue to the currently logged-in Jira user after creating the Git branch
  -f, --force    disable interactive prompts and force branch creation even if checks would normally prevent it
  -h, --help     help for branch
```

#### Example
```
‚ùØ gira branch ISSUE-123
Branch feature/ISSUE-123/update-app-dependencies-to-the-latest-version will be generated
Press ENTER to continue, CTRL+C to cancel
```

### üïµÔ∏è `issue`: Show details of issue (from current branch or specified issue ID)

Displays detailed information about a Jira issue.

- If no issue ID is provided, the issue associated with the current Git branch is used.
- If an issue ID is specified, the command will display information for that issue.

This includes the issue key, summary, description, status, priority, assignee, and other relevant metadata.

Useful for quickly reviewing the context of your work without leaving the terminal.

Usage:
  gira issue [issueId] [flags]

  -h, --help   help for issue
